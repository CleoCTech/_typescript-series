1. Insall typescript globally by using this command: 
	npm i typescript -g



If you're receiving a "command not recognized" error when trying to run a TypeScript file using the `tsc` command, it means that the TypeScript compiler is not installed or not properly configured on your system. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure TypeScript is installed: Verify that TypeScript is installed on your machine by running `tsc -v` in the command line. If you receive a "command not recognized" error, it means TypeScript is not installed.

2. Install TypeScript globally: To install TypeScript globally, you can use the following command (assuming you have Node.js and npm installed):

   ```
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

   This command installs TypeScript globally on your system, making it accessible from anywhere on the command line.

3. Ensure TypeScript is added to the PATH: If TypeScript is already installed, it's possible that the installation directory is not added to your system's PATH environment variable. To add it, follow these steps:

   - Locate the installation directory of TypeScript. It is usually in the `node_modules` folder within the global `npm` installation directory. On Windows, the path might look like: `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\typescript\bin`.
   - Add the TypeScript installation directory to the PATH environment variable. Instructions for adding directories to the PATH vary based on your operating system.

4. Verify the installation: After installing or configuring TypeScript, open a new command prompt or terminal window and try running `tsc -v` again to ensure it's recognized. If the command executes successfully and displays the TypeScript version, you should be able to compile TypeScript files using the `tsc` command.

C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\typescript\bin
